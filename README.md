# Fur generation using Python and PyOpenGL

This project was done as part of a Graphics module within my Master's Degree. The program will render fur on an object. Within the current settings, the fur will be rendered on a rock or a bunny rabbit. 

To see an example of the code running, please watch the demo video.

To see the requirements to run the program, please look at the PYTHONREQUIREMENTS.txt file.

## How to run:

FurApp.py is the main file, and that will run the program.

## Buttons:

L - Increases fur length

K - Decreases fur length

M - Increases fur density

N - Decreases fur density

ARROWS - Rotate around the object

R - Changes the object to a rock

B - Changes the object to a bunny
